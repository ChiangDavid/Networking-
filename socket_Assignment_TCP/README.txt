Instruction about how to connect to server and client 

For server:
Just type ./server
And it will create the server connection

For Client:
I use port number 7000 for the server and local connection from the desktop
that you connected from

So, the way to call the client is:
./client "local" "7000"  7000 is the port number that I created for the server
